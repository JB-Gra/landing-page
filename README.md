# Landing Page Project

## About the project
This webpage is a recreation of a landing page based on the one provided by the lesson **Project: Landing Page**, part of The Odin Project course.

It's aim is to apply all the knowledge learned across the HTML, CSS and Flexbox lessons, so the student has a better understanding of the concepts seen in those lessons and how to use them in a real-life project.
